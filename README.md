# VolleyballScoreDisplaying  
In My 2nd Year in HoChiMinh University of Tecnology, I have a subject called Logic Design with Verilog  
My last Assignment is to design a Volleyball Score Table complying basic Volleyball's rules:
+ A match has maximally 5 set;  
+ 1st - 4th set has winner number of points is 25 and the final's is 15;  
+ The set winner is the team has more than the opponent at least 2 points and has more or equal to that set's winner number of points;  
+ The winner is the firt team to win 3 sets;
My team using Verilog Language and DE2i-150 FPGA Development Kit to Realize our idea.
